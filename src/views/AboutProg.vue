        <h1>What is Information Technology?</h1>
        <br/>
        <h4>For many people, information technology (IT) is synonymous with the individuals we call for help when our computers aren’t working. While this view isn’t necessarily incorrect, information technology encompasses much more. IT involves the governance and maintenance of computer systems and their operations, along with the development and management of infrastructure such as networks and software.

From that, we can safely say that information technology comprises everything from hardware, software, networking and cloud computing to data security and technical support. It includes the design and development of apps and tools, analysis and management of data, IT infrastructure planning and implementation, cybersecurity and more.

There are many information technology degree jobs and specialization opportunities, and they only continue to grow. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) predicts 11% growth in information technology occupations through 2029.1 This is much faster than the average for all occupations and includes approximately 531,200 new IT jobs to be added.</h4>

        <h1>Why is Information Technology Important?</h1>
        <h4>At its core, information technology serves to solve business or organizational problems on a broad scale. Without functioning IT systems, work in many organizations may likely come to a halt. It would be difficult in the modern era to find a business that doesn’t at least partially rely on computers and the networks that connect them.

And as competition rises among markets, many businesses find it necessary to implement more sophisticated programs and solutions. Having strong IT systems can potentially help set businesses apart from their competitors by outsmarting, outpacing and out-delivering them.</h4>
