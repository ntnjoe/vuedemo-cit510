      <h4>The Technological Institute of the Philippines (T.I.P.) is one of the country’s premier technological, engineering, and computing higher educational institutions.  It is a private non-sectarian stock school founded on February 8, 1962 by a group of educators headed by Engineer Demetrio A. Quirino, Jr. and Dr. Teresita U. Quirino. Using an outcomes-based educational model with its locally and globally accredited programs, T.I.P. allows students to acquire industry-desired qualities and essential experiences that better equip them to be effective as soon as they enter the workforce or set up their own business.</h4>
    <br/>
    <h4>T.I.P. laid down its objective based on its founders’ vision: 1) to maintain high standards of instruction; 2) to bring within the reach of the masses the blessings of higher education; and 3) to cooperate with the government in the implementation of its economic and social amelioration programs.</h4>
    <br/>
    <h4>The school committed itself to educating and developing men and women who could turn the wheels of progress and industry. T.I.P.’s initial offering of courses included Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Architecture. It also offered Industrial Education, Industrial Arts, Liberal Arts, High School, and various trade courses.</h4>
    <br/>
    <h4>T.I.P.’s first site was the Lorenzana Building in Quiapo, Manila. The school had an initial enrollment of 2,400 which steadily increased throughout the years, prompting the school to slowly but surely expand. In 1967, it set up its main site at G. Puyat Street, Quiapo, Manila.</h4>
    <br/>
    <h4>The institution then directed itself towards specialization in the field of technology. In 1977, it offered a two-year associate course in Marine Engineering. Then in 1980, the Liberal Arts, Education, and High School programs were phased out to make way for the school’s new thrust.</h4>
    <br/>
    <h4>In 1981, additional buildings were leased and the T.I.P. P. Casal, Quiapo location was opened to accommodate the growing student population which had reached over 23,000. T.I.P. Arlegui was opened three years later across P. Casal, both areas being collectively known as the T.I.P. Manila campus. Currently, T.I.P. Manila has four (4) main buildings across the combined 2.3-hectares of the two sites.</h4>
    <br/>
    <h4>The founders opened T.I.P. Quezon City in 1983 along 20th Avenue of Cubao as their answer to the Philippine government’s call for dispersal to decongest the Manila University Belt. Through the years, the Quezon City campus acquired adjacent properties, including a frontage along Aurora Boulevard in the early 2000s. At present, T.I.P. Quezon City has ten (10) main buildings spread out in its 3.3-hectare site.</h4>
