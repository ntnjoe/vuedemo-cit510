        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
        <br/>
        <h4>My name is Joe Christian Natan. 22 years old residing in the beautiful city of Bulacan. I am currently studying as a 4th year college student in Technological Institute of the Philippines(TIP). There is not much for me to say. I am pretty much a simple guy. I love my coffes and my bed. I love watching crime or thriller movies. I used to watch a lot of animes but due to the tight-packed schedule and being a graduating student, I do not have that kind liberty anymore.</h4>  
        <br/>
        <h1>What Are My Plans for the Future?</h1>
        <h4>I do not really have that huge plan in mind. I just want to finish my studies, work as a web developer and hopefully open up a business in the near future. Since I am an only child, I do not have anything to spend my money on. So I am also planning on buying a house.
